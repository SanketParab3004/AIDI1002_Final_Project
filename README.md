# AIDI 1002 Final Project: Neural Network Design and Training

## Project Overview
This project is part of the AIDI 1002 course at Georgian College. The task involves designing and training a neural network model. We have chosen to implement and enhance a methodology from a research paper that we selected as part of the project requirements. The key aspects of this project include:

- **Reproducing Results**: Reproducing the results of the selected research paper.
- **Contribution**: Making a significant contribution to the methodology by testing new datasets, experimenting with model parameters, or introducing additional models.

## Selected Research Paper
**Title**: Vision Transformer (ViT)  
**Authors**: Alexey Dosovitskiy, Lucas Beyer, Alexander Kolesnikov, Dirk Weissenborn, et al.  
**Year of Publication**: 2020  
**GitHub Repository**: [https://github.com/google-research/vision_transformer](https://github.com/google-research/vision_transformer)
