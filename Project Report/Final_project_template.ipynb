Traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been the go-to solution for image classification tasks due to their ability to capture local patterns in images. However, they often struggle to model long-range dependencies. The Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, introduced in the research paper \"An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale\" by Dosovitskiy et al. (2020), addresses this limitation by adapting the Transformer architecture, initially designed for Natural Language Processing (NLP), to the domain of computer vision.
